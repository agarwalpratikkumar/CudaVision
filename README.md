Learning Vision systems on Graphics cards.<br>
<br>
**Assignment 1 :** Logistic Regression on CIFAR-10 dataset using pure numpy. <br>
<br>
**MNIST with MLP :** Multilayer Perceptron performed on MNIST dataset. <br>
<br>
**Assignment :** CIFAR10 - Using Logistic Regression. (Assignment 4) <br>(I) Add regularization to your CFAR-10 model (Dropout, L1, and L2). <br> (II) Find how deep the model can be and still improving.<br> (III)Draw confusion matrix. <br> (IV) Use five different optimizers and compare their results and convergence time (SGD, Adam, Adagrad, Adadelta, RMSprop). <br> (V) Use three different activation functions (ReLu, Tanh, Sigmoid) <br>
<br>
**Assignment 2 :** Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). <br>
<br>
**Assignment 3 :** Convolutional Autoencoder on CIFAR10. <br>
<br>
**Assignment 5 :** To fine tune a pretrained network. <br> Dataset: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1I4928zz9hu02TNPQ2fUN-gJN-vJsxH2K/view <br>
<br>
**Assignment 7 :** LSTM and a GRU model for MNIST dataset <br>
<br>
**Assignment 8 :**  Generator - Descriminator model for the soccerball dataset. <br>
<br>
**Project** :  Detection and Localization of a Soccer ball from an input image with feed-forward Fully Convolutional Neural Networks (FCNN).   <br>
(I) To implement SweatyNet1 model from Homonoids Robocup workshop 2017 for detection and localization of Soccer ball. <br>
(II) Train a convLSTM model on top of it with continuous sequence of frames. <br>
(III) Calculate recall and false detection rate to check accuracy of model. <br>
